                <p>
                    This was my senior design project that spanned two semesters. I worked with Frontier Scientific as well as six other
                    <br> 
                    students to make a plate builder that allowed users to easily add and edit specific compounds they needed mixed.
                    <br>
                    I helped on nearly every aspect of this project, but my main focus was making sure the main functionality with the 
                    <br>
                    grid itself worked well and was intuitive to use.

            <div class="projectDesc">
                <p>
                    This project was for my Advanced Web Technologies class where we learned about web deelopment and what makes a 
                    <br>
                    webpage look good and easy to navigate. I worked with a small group and we made a simple platformer game where
                    <br>
                    the player controlled a small dinosaur and had to complete puzzles and collect all the coins while avoiding  
                    <br>
                    enemies in order to progress to the next level. My part in this was making sure we had consistency across  
                    <br>
                    all of our different pages as well as level design and playtesting.
