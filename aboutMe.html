        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a senior Comupter Science major from New Castle, Delaware. I enjoy playing video games and have recently 
        been consumed by Final Fantasy 14. I also really enjoy playing rhythm games and a couple of my favorites are osu! and A Dance of Fire and Ice.
        After this past year of being at home, I can't express how glad I am to be back on campus and I am really looking forward to this class.</p><br>

        <h2>Interesting fact about me</h2>
        I used to speedrun the game Super Mario Galaxy. My fastest time was 2 hours 49 minutes and 36 seconds.<br>
        Even though its been a long time since I played it, I could probably still finish in under 3 hours.
        
        <h3>My interests in web development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>UI design</li>
            <li>Learning a new language</li>
            <li>Making things I can easily share with my friends</li>
